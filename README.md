# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project is a beginner-friendly, end-to-end implementation of the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm for classifying Iris flowers using Python and scikit-learn. It includes both the **theory** behind SVM and a **hands-on coding walkthrough** — perfect for learners who want to understand both the *why* and the *how*.

## 📚 Project Overview

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📌 **Theory** | Learn about decision boundaries, support vectors, hyperplanes, margin, and SVM hyperparameters like `C`, `gamma`, and `kernel`. |
| 🛠️ **Implementation** | Use the Iris dataset to build an SVM classifier in Python using `scikit-learn`. |
| 📊 **Visualization** | Visualize the flower classes using `matplotlib` to see how SVM separates them. |
| ⚙️ **Tuning** | Tune hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`, and `kernel`) and evaluate model accuracy. |
| 🎯 **Exercise** | Apply SVM to the `digits` dataset and experiment with parameters to improve accuracy. |
